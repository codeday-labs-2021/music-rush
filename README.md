**About the project**:
We'll create a review and recommendation site for music.

Users should have a way to provide information about the target. For the sake of example, let's say it's travel destinations. Users should be able to provide information like photos, reviews, ratings, Q&A, etc.

Stretch goal for folks interested in AI/math-y stuff would be to add a recommendation engine (e.g. based on matrix factorization) based on user preferences, whether either explicitly indicated or implied.
Deliverables: - Users can contribute reviews
- Users can browse reviews
- [Stretch] Users can indicate preferences that they have and get recommendations based on their explicit preferences, interactions with existing reviews, and other users' interactions with the same.
